# TeamBuilder backend

This is the backend for the sports team management application TeamBuilder. The application allows for the creation and management of balanced teams for sports, with player profiles, match history, and other relevant details. The backend is built using NestJS, PostgreSQL as the database, and Prisma as the ORM.

## Features

- Group Creation: Create groups with many members and different roles to register matches and players.
- Player Management: Create, update, delete players, and manage their profiles.
- Match History: Save the history of wins, draws, and losses for teams.
- Balanced Team Generation: Create balanced teams based on player skills.
- Authentication and Authorization: Role and permission management using JWT and Passport.
- Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting: Support for optimized data queries through URLs.
- Group Management: Access control based on visualization settings (public or private) and authenticated user permissions.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.x or higher)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (v13 or higher)
